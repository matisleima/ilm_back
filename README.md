This is a test assignment from September 2023. The task was 
to connect to an external weather API and build an interface 
that shows the 3 weather parameters of a chosen city at current 
time. In addition to that, the user can save the current city to a 
list of cities according to which new queries will be made with 15min
intervals. Weather data for all cities tin the list is then recorded 
to database and displayed to user. The data can be deleted and cities
added to and removed from the list.

NOTE: This application can be used with a PostgreSQL local database or with a
H2 in-memory database. Please choose one by typing either "postgres" or "h2"
to the "Active profiles" input area in Run Configurations.
